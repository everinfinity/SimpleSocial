# Deployment

This work-in-progress document outlines steps necessary to deploy the site.

## DigitalOcean App Platform

We are using DigitalOcean App Platform to auto-deploy and manage the site.

1. create a new DigitalOcean App, such as "westernfriend-website"
2. make sure to add a database along with the app during the creation process or after
3. configure the deployment to be triggered when changes are merged to the `main` branch of this repo
4. configure a domain (or subdomain) to point to the deployed app

### After the initial deployment

1. run migrations
2. create a superuser

### Static files

We need a space to store static files. For that, we will use DO Spaces.

1. create a Spaces Bucket
2. edit the CORS settings with the following values (substituting actual values where needed)

```yaml
Origin: https://domain-name.com
Allowed Methods: GET
Allowed Headers:
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin
- Referer
Access Control Max Age: 600
```

## Environment variables

Environment variables are added through the DigitalOcean App Platform configuration for the specific app.

## Running migrate and collectstatic

The app can be configured with custom run command such as the following.

```sh
python manage.py migrate && python manage.py collectstatic --no-input
```

### Data prep/import

Refer to the [content migration](CONTENT_MIGRATION.md) guide for further details about preparing data for import. Once the data have been prepared, use the following steps to import them to the online website.

1. copy all import files (CSV format) to the DO Spaces bucket for import data
2. run the import commands via the DO App console, using the bucket location (HTTPS) as a target

## CiviCRM

CiviCRM stores contacts that are used in our Community Directory.

### Organizations (incl. meetings and worship groups)

2. Set the search criteria to "is Organization"
   - this is because we only want organizations for our community directory

5. Click "Select fields for export"
6. Choose "Organization export (mailing and worship)"
7. Click "Continue"

Import the contacts with the following command.

```sh
python manage.py import_civicrm_contacts --file path/to/file.csv
```
